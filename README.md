# Expense Tracker API

Expense Tracker API is a backend application that helps users manage their personal expenses. Users can register, log in, update their username, delete their account, and perform CRUD operations on their expenses. The API also supports filtering expenses by dates and categories.

This project is inspired by the **Expense Tracker API** from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh).

## Features
- **Account management**: Users can register, login, update their username, and delete their account.
- **JWT Authentication**: The API is protected by JSON Web Tokens (JWT), ensuring that only authenticated users can access their data.
- **Expense management**: Users can create, read, update, and delete their expenses. Expenses can be filtered by dates and categories.
- **Secure & Scalable Database**: Uses PostgreSQL, with sensitive settings managed through an `.env` file for easy database switching.
- **Database Migrations**: Schema updates are managed via Alembic migrations.
- **Automated Testing**: Uses `pytest` for unit testing to ensure everything works correctly.

## How to Use
